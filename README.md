# DuddleDash!

DuddleDash! is a browser-based platformer where you control a cute little guy called a Duddle. You must avoid enemies and traps, while growing more and more limbs as you gather up the tasty uranium.

#### 1 - High Concept
DuddleDash! is a platformer where your health is the number of limbs you currently have. 

#### 2 - Genre
It's an Platformer. Clever thinking and limb management utilizing the physics system will be tested. 

#### 3 - Platform
This game will be designed to be played in-browser. 

#### 4 - Story
After escaping from the moon, the Duddle finds itself in a secret laboratory in deep space! How did it get there? What is the lab doing in space? All of your questions and more will be answered, as long as you have the limbs!

#### 5 - Esthetics
The graphics style is quite simple and sort of cartoony. The sound will be kind of techno and funky - boasting a full one song soundtrack and over three different sound effects when enemies are hit and objectives are met.

#### 6 - Gameplay
At its heart, DuddleDash! is a platformer. However, as the Duddle rolls around, its limbs move as well. Keeping the limbs away from enemies and balancing a rolling ball of a constantly changing diameter is the key to victory. The player can maneuver the Duddle using WASD.

#### 8 - Other
This game is a sequel to a game I made over three years ago called DuddleRun. That game was just a regular sidescroller I made in a three-person team at a coding bootcamp in NYC. Now that I actually know how to program decently, I'd like to revisit this concept from a completely new angle, making some gameplay adjustments (Sidescroller->Platformer), and with a real physics engine that takes advantage of the many limbs that the Duddle possesses. The only similarities should be the main character and the theme of limb generation. If you would like me to come up with a completely new game idea, I can do that but I might be a little bit bitter.
