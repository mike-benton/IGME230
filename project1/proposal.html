		<p> 1) It's like Zelda, but there's a real plot. </p>
		<p> 2) It's an Adventure/Exploration kind of game. But it's really just supposed to be kind of funny and a little meta. </p>
		<p> 3) It's for desktop only.  Maybe it'll like kind of function on mobile but it'll be super janky. </p>
		<p> 4) The avatar (who you can name of course (but the default name is really cool.  like lance. or dennis.)) must save the world from darkness using the power of friendship, courage, and knowledge of game design. The player probably won't be motivated to do this, so there'll be a joke peppered in every couple of levels to keep them chugging along.</p>
		<p> 5) The wondrous world of stolen textures from 8-bit games. Unless I can get someone to do art for me. In which case I will have non-stolen 8-bit art. Also I'm thinking this game could lend nicely for a full voice over by some big-name voice actor.  Like Mark Hamill. Or Matt Mercer. </p> 
		<p> 6) The core mechanic is just talking to npcs.  You can kill some things too, I guess.  Moving around is done with the mouse, and abilities are done with the left side of the keyboard.  Maybe we'll throw in controller support. </p>
		<p> 7) Wait is this supposed to be a serious thing? I think I did this assignment incorrectly. </p>
